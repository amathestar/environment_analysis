This is a Data Analysis project on Environmental Data. The data is retrieved from Kaggle

Background
An agency has tasked me  to monitor and analyze environmental data
from multiple cities. 

The dataset includes:
daily measurements of temperature,
humidity, rainfall, and
wind speed for the past year. 

The agency is particularly interested in understanding seasonal patterns,
relationships between climatic variables, and anomalies in the data. My analysis supports
policy-making for climate adaptation and disaster management.
