Data analysis on Environmental Data. 

Source of data: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

Background : 
An agency has tasked me  to monitor and analyze environmental data from multiple cities. 

The dataset includes:
daily measurements of temperature,
humidity, rainfall, and
wind speed for the past year. 

The agency is particularly interested in understanding 
1. seasonal patterns,
2. relationships between climatic variables, and
3. anomalies in the data.

My analysis was done in R and it supports policy-making for climate adaptation and disaster management.
